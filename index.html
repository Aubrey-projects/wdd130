            <h3>My Mission in Ecuador</h3>
            <p>Depending on where you are in Ecuador, it is like a completely different country. There is the coast, which was my first location, where the weather is hot and humid most of the time. Where I served, it was also where most of the poorer people lived and crime was more prevalent. I had many close calls with wild dogs, but I survived just fine. Then there are the mountains. This is the more touristy area where people would come to visit. I served here the latter half of my mission. The weather is cooler and it was much weathier with less crime.</p>
            <img src="images/AND gate.jpg" alt="An AND Gate built on the Arduino and breadboard.">
            <p>This is an AND gate built on the Arduino Uno. It is a simple logic gate that is used in many coding languages, like Python. Both inputs need to be positive, or both yellow wires need to be plugged into HIGH voltage, in order for the LED to light up.</p>
            <img src="images/OR gate.jpg" alt="An OR Gate built on the Arduino and breadboard.">
            <p>This is an OR gate built on the Arduino Uno. Like the AND gate, it is a simple logic gate that is used in almost all programming languages. Either one of the inputs, or yellow wires, need to be positive, or in other words, plugged into HIGH voltage for the LED to light up.</p>
